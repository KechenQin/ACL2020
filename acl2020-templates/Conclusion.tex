\section{Conclusion}

In this paper, We introduce a novel KBQA system which can leverage information from multiple reasoning paths. To train our model, we propose to use a marginalized probability objective function and give detailed analysis to demonstrate the benefits of using the it. Experimental results show that our model achieve strong performance on three popular KBQA datasets.
