\section{Conclusion}

In this paper, We introduce a novel multi-hop KBQA system, which can predict the relation sequence of any length without pre-defining the number of maximum hops and generate final answers at the last hop. To train our model with multiple relation paths, we propose to use a marginal probability objective function and give detailed analysis to demonstrate the benefits of using the new loss function. Experimental results show that our model achieve state-of-the-art performance on three popular KBQA datasets for single-hop and multi-hop questions.
