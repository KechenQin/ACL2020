\section{Conclusion}

In this paper, We introduce a novel KBQA system which can leverage information from multiple reasoning paths. The system can output diverse relation paths, and reward the ``better'' paths over the inferior ones by assigning ``better'' paths higher probabilities. To train our model, we propose to use a marginalized probability objective function and give detailed analysis to demonstrate the benefits of using the it. Experimental results show that our model achieve strong performance on three popular KBQA datasets.
