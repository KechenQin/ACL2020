 Multi-hop knowledge based question answering (KBQA) is a complex task for natural language understanding. Many KBQA approaches have been proposed in recent years, and most of them are trained based on labeled reasoning path. This hinders the system's performance as many correct reasoning paths are not labeled as ground truth, and thus they cannot be learned by the model. In this paper, we introduce an end-to-end KBQA system which can leverage multiple reasoning paths' information and only requires labeled answer as supervision. We conduct experiments on several benchmark datasets containing both single-hop simple questions as well as muti-hop complex questions, including WebQuestionSP (WQSP), ComplexWebQuestion-1.1 (CWQ), and PathQuestion-Large (PQL). The model achieves strong performance on all the datasets on all metrics.
