 Multi-hop knowledge based question answering (KBQA) is a complex task for natural language understanding. Many KBQA approaches have been proposed in recent years, and most of them are trained based on one possible ground truth relation path and constrained by a fixed maximum number of hops. This hinders the system's performance as the trained model may not leverage multiple relation paths' information.\kechen{and can't handle some conjunction questions?} In this paper, we introduce a novel entity-relation prediction model, which is not only unrestricted by the number of hops, but also can leverage multiple relation paths' information by using the proposed marginal probability objective function. We conduct experiments on several benchmark datasets containing both single-hop simple questions as well as muti-hop complex questions, including PathQuestion-Large (PQL), WebQuestionSP (WQSP), and ComplexWebQuestion-1.1 (CWQ). The model achieves strong performance on all the datasets on all metrics without using extra features and labels.
